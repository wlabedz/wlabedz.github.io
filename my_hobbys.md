Although I study Computer Science, it has never been my biggest hobby.<br/>
I love travelling, meeting new cultures, experiencing something new, learning foreign languages and deepening my geographical knowledge.<br/>
My dream was to study [Baltic Philology](http://www.polon.uw.edu.pl/filologia-baltycka), however I realized it wasn't the best idea.<br/>
I also dream of visiting Iceland one day/<br/>
[ICELAND]()
